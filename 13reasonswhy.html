    <h1>13 Reasons Why</h1>
  </div>
  </div>
<p>It’s March of 2017, and Netflix has just released a new original series for you and your friends to binge watch. All the hours spent watching a somewhat authentic approach to what high school life is like (sex, rape, drugs), could’ve never prepared an audience for what was the most graphic scene of the entire first season. Hannah Baker’s suicide scene.<br><br>

A month later and according to a study conducted by the National Institute of Health, there was a 29 percent spike in US teen suicides, which mental health specialists think was influenced by suicide contagion. Suicide contagion, or copycat suicide, is the exposure to multimedia including suicide or suicidal behaviors, which can result in an increase of suicide or suicidal behaviors of those who emulate such acts. Ways that “13 Reasons Why” contributed to the suicide contagion following the days after it was released was by depicting the suicide in an overly graphic detail, glorifying Hannah, and achieving her personal goal of letting everyone know how they contributed to her death.<br><br>

Despite the mixed reactions of its audience, the show has encouraged some positive actions of those who weren’t as vulnerable as others. For example:  Research done by ScienceDirect shows that those who finished the second season of the show are more likely to be interested in helping those around them who struggle with mental illness. Thus, in some ways the show is helping to start the conversation surrounding mental illness while helping to erase some of the stigma around the topic. <br><br>

In conclusion, Netflix’s decision to cut Hannah’s death scene and edit it to a more screen-friendly is appreciated, but comes 2 years too late for all the damage it has caused at-risk teenagers who have taken their life after witnessing the controversial scene. </p>
