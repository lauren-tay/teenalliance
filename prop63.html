    <h1>Prop 63</h1>
  </div>
  </div>
<p>Despite being passed nearly 15 years ago, the “Mental Health Services Act” has yet to bring any lasting or meaningful impact to those living in impoverished communities; or the homeless on the streets whose struggle with mental illness is a key factor to losing their ability to live independent in the first place.<br><br>

This act was passed in November, 2004 and was created with the purpose of diagnosing children, teens, adults and seniors. This includes prevention and early intervention services with medical and supportive care being at the utmost priority. In order to reach out to more people in the community, the money from income tax, would be invested into programs which showed results of improving the mental health of those who participated, especially in disadvantaged communities. The MHSA also meant that those who were affected long term with the financial strain, and the state’s budget wouldn’t be as stretched.<br><br>

Untreated mental illnesses are on of the leading causes of suicide and disability. Without this proposition, families living paycheck-to-paycheck struggle under the financial constraints of not being able to afford appropriate treatment. Children, especially, are susceptible to becoming socially inept, and falling behind in school. Additionally, adults with crippling mental illnesses can no longer take care of themselves and end up homeless on the streets; often getting arrested or hospitalized for illnesses that have gone without treatment for too long. Additionally, the state would spend billions of dollars each year in emergency services (emergency medical care, unemployment, jail/prison costs) catered towards those individuals.<br><br>

Unfortunately, as well-intentioned as 2004 Prop 63 is, California’s measures towards effectively dealing with this mental health issue are lost (as well as a majority of audit reports) and misguided spending isn’t the biggest reason for why the execution of this proposition is ineffective. Despite managing to close some psychiatric hospitals, the counties of California have made little to no moves towards investing money into programs that emphasize outreach in the community. No longer is money the issue for carrying out this act, but the county’s failure to introduce new and better alternatives is what truly halts the progress towards getting the homeless off the streets, and preventing mental illness from debilitating even more people. With hundreds of millions of dollars just sitting in numerous county accounts, it’s amazing how lack of direction and guidelines from the state can lead to inadequacies in our communities.</p>
